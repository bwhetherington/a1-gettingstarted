## Technical Achievements

- **Custom Server Script:** I solved the problems with the original server script by writing my own from scratch. In addition, it restricts access to only files in the static directory to ensure that people cannot access other files on the server.

## Design Achievements

- **Custom CSS:** I wrote my own CSS for the website. It is admittedly quite simple, but it is something.
